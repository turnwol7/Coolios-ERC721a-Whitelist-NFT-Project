Complete ASTARIA interview, get requirements for Whitelist NFT Mint project
Consume Youtube, Blogs, Docs and GitHub Repo on ERC721A

March 20, 2024
ERC721 docs are common but not ERC721A
Need to figure out how to make a Whitelist
Discover Merkle Tree whitelist method
Research SHA256 hashing with decentralized apps

March 21, 2024
Look for base contract template using ERC721A
Found one from "Inverted Mfers"
Figure out how Remix works to test different functions
Still need to change things around and figure how to add merkle root hash proof

March 22, 2024
Got base contract to work with merkleroot inside constructor which is used in whitelistmint functions
When you run mint(with merkle proof) it properly maps to the whitelist addresses of my Remix
Still wondering if this is actually using the mint inside ERC721A because my supply isnt changing

March 23, 2024
Starting with working contract with merkle list
Applying logic for ASTARIA requirements
Need to see how to implement ownerOf()?
How do i Know its using the ERC721A gas optimized characteristics of ERC721A???
We have the verification from whitelist, need to implement the actuall minting.

Got a working copy of the contract

fufills requirements from ASTARIA
-can deploy with merkleproof
-can mint to whitelist addresses
-can only mint once
-not on list == cant mint

TESTS for gas
I have 4 addresses on my remix that I am minting from
mintint 1 each time, one address at a time

1.
gas --> 162513
tx --> 135715
exc --> 116031

2.
gas --> 142864
tx --> 118629
exc --> 98921

3.
gas --> 142875
tx --> 118639
exc --> 98931

4.
gas --> 142887
tx --> 118649 
exc --> 98941 

//total supply now 4

TESTs for minting multiple NFTs in one got
-minting 10 with each address
-********BUG********* why can I mint 10 for the same 1000 finney, wouldnt it be 10000 for 10???

1.
gas --> 182468 
tx -->  153067 
exc -->  133383 

2. 
gas -->  162819 
tx -->   135981 
exc -->   116273

Troubleshooting the value sent with the mint function.
my cost is .1 ether per mint
.1 ether = 1000 finney

My math for the total cost in chcek cost was wrong.

Also .1 ether is 100 finney. thats why my 10 batch mint was going through
for 1000 finney when i was expecting it to be 10,000 finney

BACK TO TESTING BATCH GAS OPTIMIZATIONS
-test 1 mint on each address to see transaction gas cost

1. tx --> 135715
2. tx --> 118629
3. tx --> 118639
4. tx --> 118649

-now batch test minting 10 each time for 4 addresses. total value = 1000 finney each time

1. tx --> 153067
2. tx --> 135981
3. tx --> 135991
4. tx --> 136001

Need to test what happens if someone tries to mint 666 tokens at one time.
--out of range

Set a MAX_BATCH size of 20

TAKE CONTRACT FROM REMIX AND INITIALIZE FORGE TEST SUITE
-Write tests for Coolios contract
-started write some test for forge using the merkletree - not done
-need to see what tests we actually need
